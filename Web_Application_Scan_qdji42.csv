  - A flaw exists in the lua_websocket_read() function in
    the 'mod_lua' module due to incorrect handling of
    WebSocket PING frames. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, by sending a crafted WebSocket PING frame after a
    Lua script has called the wsupgrade() function, to crash
    a child process, resulting in a denial of service
    condition. (CVE-2015-0228)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    read_request_line() function due to a failure to
    initialize the protocol structure member. A remote 
    attacker can exploit this flaw, on installations that
    enable the INCLUDES filter and has an ErrorDocument 400
    directive specifying a local URI, by sending a request
    that lacks a method, to cause a denial of service
    condition. (CVE-2015-0253)

  - A flaw exists in the chunked transfer coding
    implementation due to a failure to properly parse chunk
    headers. A remote attacker can exploit this to conduct
    HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

  - A flaw exists in the ap_some_auth_required() function
    due to a failure to consider that a Require directive
    may be associated with an authorization setting rather
    than an authentication setting. A remote attacker can
    exploit this, if a module that relies on the 2.2 API
