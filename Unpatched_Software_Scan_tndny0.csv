This situation can occur in threedifferent ways, each of which results in a break in the chain belowwhich certificates cannot be trusted. First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might notbe descended from a known public certificate authority.  This canoccur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signedcertificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that wouldconnect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificateauthority. Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is notvalid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scanoccurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after oneof the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that eitherdidn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate withthe bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures thatcould not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer usinga signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does notrecognize. If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in thechain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.
